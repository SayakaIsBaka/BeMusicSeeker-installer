About output folders
--------------------
Adding a table in BeMusicSeeker will result in a folder being created on your computer. This folder will be stored in one of two locations that you have to set up upon launching the program for the first time:

Output (normal folder):
This is the default location.
Immediately after adding a table, BeMusicSeeker will store the folder corresponding to that table in the directory indicated in "Output (normal folder)" in the options.
You can only set this directory to a folder that is already registered in your LR2 jukebox.

Output (root folder):
Additionally, if you right click on a table and go to Property → Custom folder and enable “Make root folder”, you can set a table to appear at the "root" of LR2's song select screen (the very first folders you see when you start the game, where the 段位認定 / COURSE folders are), allowing for faster access.
When doing so, BeMusicSeeker will store the folder corresponding to the table in the directory indicated in "Output (root folder)" in the options
You can set that directory to be any folder on your computer, but it must NOT be a folder that is already registered in your jukebox (or a subfolder of that folder).
To make management easier, it is recommended to create a new folder on your computer dedicated to this purpose.
